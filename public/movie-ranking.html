<h3>Training Day</h3>
<p>Amazing movie starring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke which takes place in los Angeles back in 2001. This movie is excellent as it contrasts a newer officer joining the force and a veteran officer whom have been corrupted from the job.</p>

<P>Excellent DC Comics movie from 2008 that showcases Batman and his rouge's gallery.</P>

<h3>Batman Beyond</h3>
<p>One movie I've seen a million times as kid. This was gifted to me from my uncle and ranks as one of my favorites ever.</p>
